    <h2>Published Safety Standards (CSAE)</h2>
    <p>MeBeer takes child safety seriously. While MeBeer is intended for users aged 21 and older, we maintain the following publicly published standards to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We prohibit any content that sexualizes minors or facilitates sexual contact involving minors.</li>
      <li>We implement age-gating and require users to confirm they are 21+ before using the app.</li>
      <li>We monitor and investigate reports of abusive or concerning behavior submitted by users.</li>
      <li>We retain clear procedures for reporting suspected CSAE to law enforcement and relevant authorities.</li>
      <li>We provide in-app reporting tools for users to flag content or behavior that may indicate CSAE.</li>
      <li>We cooperate with platform and law enforcement investigations and preserve relevant logs and evidence when required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These standards are published here as an HTML page (this page) and are publicly available for review.</p>
